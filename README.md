=============

This project is of no consequence to you. Move along.

Still here? *sigh* Okay, this _may_ be of interest to you if you are looking to
do something custom with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)
([code](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll))
([wiki](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki)). We have an example generator
and a custom Liquid filter, which I haven't found anywhere else.
(Not saying folks aren't using filters, just that I haven't seen it.)
