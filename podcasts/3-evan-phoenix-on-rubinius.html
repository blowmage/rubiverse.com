<p>I recently talked with <a href="http://blog.fallingsnow.net/">Evan Phoenix</a> about the <a href="http://rubini.us/">Rubinius</a> project. Rubinius is an alternate implementation of Ruby using many of the implementation approaches used by Smalltalk. Rubinius has the eventual goal of being self-hosting; or writing Ruby in Ruby.</p>
<p>Listen as Evan describes how Rubinius started as:</p>
<blockquote>There's this thing, it seems kinda cool. Wow, I typed it in, but I don't really know where it is going.</blockquote>
<p>And eventually grew to:</p>
<blockquote>It could replace MRI.</blockquote>
<p>Thanks again to Evan for talking with me. I really enjoyed our conversation.</p>
<h3>Additional Interviews</h3>
